My name is Camila Balboa and I am a licensed insurance broker based in North Carolina. Before becoming an insurance broker, I worked  in healthcare for many years. My experience in the medical field has given me the knowledge of how authorizations and procedures are coded and approved with the insurance companies.

I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, which allows me to connect with clients from diverse backgrounds and better understand their individual needs.
