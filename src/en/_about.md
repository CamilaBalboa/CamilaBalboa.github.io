My name is Camila Balboa and I am a licensed insurance broker based in South Florida. Before becoming an insurance broker, I worked  in healthcare for many years. My experience in the medical field has given me the knowledge of how authorizations and procedures are coded and approved with the insurance companies.

I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, which allows me to connect with clients from diverse backgrounds and better understand their individual needs. 

As a mother of a beautiful boy, I understand the importance of securing the future for our loved ones. I will always go above and beyond to help my clients find the right product for their needs. Whether it's finding affordable health coverage or getting life insurance, I will be there to help no matter what.
